# **👨🏻‍💻Hi, my name is Gino, and I'm a developer.**

I'm currently studying programming and more specifically, web development,
 however, I'm interested in all professional fields of computer science.
 
 ## **Who am I?**
 
My name is Gino Oscar Zega, I was born in Córdoba-Argentina and I'm currently living in Tigre-Argentina. I'm 21 years old and live with my girlfriend, who is also a developer(https://github.com/DamperDoor56), and we help each other a lot! I fell in love with programming last year and I've been studying since then.

## **Why Programming?**

I'm not going to lie about this, at first, I needed to learn something with value in the world of work and get a job as fast as I could to earn my own money. Unfortunately, programming wasn't my first choice, and after several failed attempts to find something that I liked I decided to try programming, after all, I lived almost all my life around computers, maybe I could feel comfortable in the field. I was a little bit scared because I always thought programming was something about math and things that I wasn't really into. But once I started learning I understood that there was nothing to fear, there were no boring numbers and overwhelming algorithms, it was actually fun!, and at the moment I realized that I was having fun, I decided that programming was my thing.

## **What Tools Do I Work With?**

Here are a few of the tools that I use!
