# **👨🏻‍💻Hi, my name is Gino, and I'm a developer.**

I'm 21 years old and I'm a self-taught Frontend developer looking for my first IT job. I'm experienced in the MERN stack, but I'm interested in working with any modern technology. Speaking about myself, I consider myself a perfectionist person and have quite a lot of attention to detail, so I always try to make my code as clean, reusable, and maintainable as possible. I also consider myself a fast learner, I adapt to new technologies efficiently to implement them in my routine correctly and quickly, a trait that makes me feel comfortable in this industry, which is constantly changing, mutating, and updating the landscape. I love reading about computer science and learning new things, that's why on my LinkedIn profile I'm always posting theory, code, videos, and other useful stuff for my developer friends.
 
## **Why Programming?**

I'm not going to lie about this, at first, I needed to learn something with value in the world of work and get a job as fast as I could to earn my own money. Unfortunately, programming wasn't my first choice, and after several failed attempts to find something that I liked I decided to try programming, after all, I lived almost all my life around computers, maybe I could feel comfortable in the field. I was a little bit scared because I always thought programming was something about math and things that I wasn't really into. But once I started learning I understood that there was nothing to fear, there were no boring numbers and overwhelming algorithms, it was actually fun!, and at the moment I realized that I was having fun, I decided that programming was my thing.
